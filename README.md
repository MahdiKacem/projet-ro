Here's a basic `README.md` file tailored to your project structure, which appears to have a Python backend (possibly using Gurobi for optimization) and a Next.js + TypeScript frontend using Docker:

# Transportation Problem

This is a full-stack application that integrates a Python backend (using Gurobi for optimization) and a Next.js frontend. It is containerized with Docker for easy deployment and development.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- Gurobi license file (`gurobi.lic`) must be placed under `backend/`
Gurobi license file (gurobi.lic) must be placed under backend/

⚠️ **Important**: If you want to run the project with Docker, you must copy your valid `gurobi.lic` file into the `./backend` directory.
### Development Setup

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend containers
docker-compose up --build
````

### Environment Files

* `.env.local`: Local development variables for frontend
* `.env.docker`: Docker-specific environment variables

Copy example file if needed:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

---

## 🧠 Backend (Python + Gurobi)

* Implements the optimization logic in `solver.py`
* Exposes an API in `app.py`

Install dependencies manually (if not using Docker):

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

---

## 💻 Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript)

* Located under `/frontend`
* Built using modern Next.js app router structure

To run standalone:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Commands
```bash
# Build services
docker-compose build

# Start services
docker-compose up

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```
